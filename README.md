# Machine Learning Security Case Study

## Introduction
Welcome to the Machine Learning Security Case! This case study presents a real-world scenario in which you'll be tasked with reproducing various attacks outlined in the paper using the code and data provided in the GitHub repository [violent-python](https://github.com/dessertlab/violent-python). Additionally, you have the opportunity to explore and implement an attack not listed in the paper.

## Problem Statement
Your organization has recently become concerned about the security implications of machine learning models deployed in production systems. To assess the vulnerabilities and potential risks, you've been assigned the task of investigating and reproducing attacks described in the paper "[Paper Title]".
## Task
Your main task is to reproduce 10 diverse attacks from the provided paper using the code and data available in the [violent-python](https://github.com/dessertlab/violent-python) repository. You're encouraged to experiment with different techniques and approaches to achieve the desired outcomes. Feel free to make simplifying assumptions if necessary to make progress.

## Objectives
- Reproduce 10 attacks outlined in the paper using the provided code and data.
- Optionally, explore and implement additional attacks not listed in the paper.
- Document your findings and reflections in a comprehensive report.

## Instructions
1. Clone the [violent-python](https://github.com/dessertlab/violent-python) repository to your local machine.
2. Review the paper to understand the attacks you need to reproduce.
3. Implement the attacks using the provided code and data.
4. Experiment with additional attacks not listed in the paper, if possible.
5. Document your findings, including any challenges faced and insights gained, in a comprehensive report.

## Deliverables
- Reproduced attacks documented with clear explanations and code snippets.
- Report summarizing the outcome of the case study, including reflections on challenges faced, insights gained, and lessons learned.
